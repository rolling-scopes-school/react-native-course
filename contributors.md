# About this file

This file will outline the preliminary plans and development steps for this course.

# Stages

## Stage 1

- &#9745; Define modules
- &#9744; Define the contents of modules

## Stage 2

- &#9744; Develop materials for each module using **reveal.js?**
- &#9744; Develop scripts for presenting modules. In order to average out all the presentors, each presentor may have a different level of knowledge on a topic, and the people who created them will not always present the material, so we need to help them understand this material. What form these scenarios will take is still unknown.

## Stage 3

- &#9744; Develop cross-review homeworks
- &#9744; Recheck modules and update them if necessary

## Stage 4

- &#9744; Prepare recordings of module presentations and upload them to YouTube channel

## Stage 5

- &#9744; Create channels for communication with students
- &#9744; Announce the start of the course
