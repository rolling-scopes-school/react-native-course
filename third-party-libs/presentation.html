          <aside class="notes">
            React Native is an open source project and has many additional
            libraries that can be included in the project.
            <br /><br />
            In scope of this topic, we will consider a couple of them, as well
            as the most common questions that arise during development, for
            example, connecting additional fonts.

          </p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <strong>React Native Directory</strong> is a searchable database of
            libraries built specifically for React Native. This is the first
            place to look for a library for your React Native app. <br /><br />
            React Native Directory allows you to filter by
            <strong> platform compatibility</strong> , such as iOS, Android,
            Web, and Windows. If the library you would like to use is not
            currently listed there, refer to the README for the library to learn
            more. <br /><br />
            Usually libraries
            <strong> built specifically for other platforms</strong> will not
            work with React Native. Examples include react-select which is built
            for the web and specifically targets react-dom, and rimraf which is
            built for Node.js and interacts with your computer file system.
            Other libraries like lodash
            <strong> use only JavaScript language</strong> features and work in
            any environment. <br /><br />
            <br /><br />
            Developers can easily filter the best library using attributes like 
            directory <strong>score</strong>, <strong>last update</strong>, total 
            <strong>download count</strong>, <strong>star count</strong>, 
            <strong>fork count</strong>, <strong>issue count</strong>, 
            recommended library tag, and operating system support (Android, iOS, and others).
            <br /><br />
            Few questions that can help you to choose right library:
            <br />
            1. How is it going to solve my problem? The easy or hard way of problem-solving compared with other similar libraries.
            <br />
            2. Will it be actively maintained by the creators and contributors?
            <br />
            3. Are the creators and contributors are helping the users to tackle the issues?
            <br />
            4. How many people are using it?
            <br />
            5. Is the size of the library high?
            <br />
            6. How is the documentation?

        <!-- Advantages of Third-Party Libraries -->

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <strong>Save Time</strong><br/>
            The most important benefit of using third-party libraries is that it saves 
            you time as you do not need to develop the functionality that the library 
            provides. Instead, you can focus on the core business logic of your app: 
            the features that really matter. Sure, you'll still need to spend some time 
            reading the library's documentation and understanding how to integrate it, 
            but typically this is just a fraction of the time that would be required to 
            develop and test its functionality from scratch.
            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Use Pre-Tested Code</strong><br/>
            A popular library will have been used in multiple environments and use cases.
            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Use Modular Code</strong><br/>
            The library's code is naturally kept separate from the 
            rest of your application code, and communication takes place across 
            well-defined boundaries (the library's API).
            If instead, you opt to develop a feature yourself, it might be hard to 
            decouple it from the app's code.

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <strong>Dependency</strong><br/>
            If at some point, you are forced to switch libraries, your code might 
            have to undergo significant changes in order to adapt it to the new library.
            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Lack of Support</strong><br/>
            Another possible risk is that a library could be abandoned by its author.
            If that does not happen, the library may not perform optimally (or at all) on newer devices.
            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Overuse</strong><br/>
            An excess number of libraries will bloat your app by increasing its size and memory consumption. 
            In turn, this will detrimentally affect the performance of your app.
            <br/><br/>

            <strong>Security Issues</strong><br/>
            The use of third-party libraries might raise some security concerns as 
            vulnerabilities in open source libraries are increasingly targets 
            for hackers.

            The latest version of a library is typically compatible with the
            latest version of React Native.
            <br /><br />If you are using an older version, you should refer to
            the README to know which version of the library you should install.
            <br /><br />
            You can install a particular version of the library by running npm
            install library-name and specify version-number, for example: npm
            install @react-native-community/netinfo@^2.0.0.

            React Native uses CocoaPods to manage iOS project dependencies and
            most React Native libraries follow this same convention. If a
            library you are using does not, then please refer to their README
            for additional instruction. In most cases, the following
            instructions will apply.
            <br /><br />
            Run pod install in our ios directory in order to link it to our
            native iOS project. A shortcut for doing this without switching to
            the ios directory is to run npx pod-install.

            AsyncStorage is an unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value
            storage system that is global to the app. It should be used instead
            of LocalStorage.
            <br /><br />
            It is recommended that you use an abstraction on top of AsyncStorage
            instead of AsyncStorage directly for anything more than light usage
            since it operates globally.
            <br /><br />
            On iOS, AsyncStorage is backed by native code that stores small
            values in a serialized dictionary and larger values in separate
            files. On Android, AsyncStorage will use either RocksDB or SQLite
            based on what is available.
            <br /><br />
            The AsyncStorage JavaScript code is a facade that provides a clear
            JavaScript API, real Error objects, and non-multi functions. Each
            method in the API returns a Promise object.
