# Week 1

## React. Components

### What should be done:

1. Create a new app using the React template on https://codesandbox.io
2. Draw the following on the main view:
* Search Bar.\
examples:\

Input value should be saved to LocalStorage during component’s unmount. During the initialization pick the value from LocalStorage and show it.
* Cards. The more details are on the card – the better.\

6. Add tests for components. Mock LocalStorage. Add test for one card, as well as tests for the list of all cards. You can use either React Testing Library or Enzyme, but only one of them. Prefer React Testing Library.

All logical parts should be set into separate components.
### Score

The task will be checked by the mentor during the first 6 weeks. Create a Pull Request to the branch of the previous task, for mentor's checking (**DO NOT MERGE**).

1. Tests – **4 points**
2. eslint, prettier – **2 points**
3. React App + components – **9 points**

If one of the items mentioned above is not accomplished – grade for the task is **0 points**. If there are direct DOM manipulations – **0 points**.
### Repository requirements

* the task should be done in the **private school repository** [How to work with private repository](https://docs.rs.school/#/private-repository?id=%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C-%D1%81-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%BC-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BC) [RU]
* in private school’s repository create branch with the name of the task from `main` branch and work in this (dev) created branch
* the commits history should reflect the process of app creating [Commits requirements](https://docs.rs.school/#/git-convention?id=%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BA-%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2) [RU]
* after finishing development it’s necessary to make Pull Request from app’s branch to `main` branch [Pull Request requirements](https://docs.rs.school/#/pull-request-review-process?id=%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BA-pull-request-pr) [RU]
**Do not merge Pull Request from the development branch to the `main` branch**
