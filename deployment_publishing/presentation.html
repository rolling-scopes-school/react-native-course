              <li class="fragment">The key benefits of an AAB file are that it reduces the size of the software and allows developers to customize it</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                The distinction between APK and AAB files is found in resources. Everything except programming code, 
                such as images, language files, and audio, is the resource in an application. 
                While installing an app from the Play Store, Google will deploy an APK customized from AAB with the required resources.

                In an ideal situation, according to the user’s location, screen density, and processor type, 
                developers have to create and upload multiple APKs to the Play Store to make the app compatible with every device. 
                Most developers create a Universal APK that includes all of the resources (language packs, codes, and more) 
                even if you don’t need most of them on that specific device to avoid creating multiple APKs. 
                This results in a bulky APK with a larger app size, which takes longer to install and consumes more bandwidth.

                Developers submit the AAB file including compiled codes, resources, language packs, 
                and the private app signing key to Google. 
                Google can now generate and offer optimized APKs to consumers based on the configuration of their device. 
                It will help both developers and users because the size of AAB files will be lowered, 
                and consumers will be able to download apps that are less in size, 
                which will install faster and consume less data on low-end devices.

            <aside class="notes">
                An Android App Bundle is a file (with the .aab file extension) that you upload to Google Play.
                App bundles are signed binaries that organize your app’s code and resources into modules, 
                as illustrated in picture. 
                Code and resources for each module are organized similarly 
                to what you would find in an APK—and that makes sense because each of these modules may be generated as separate APKs. 
                Google Play then uses the app bundle to generate the various APKs that are served to users, 
                such as the base APK, feature APKs, configuration APKs, and (for devices that do not support split APKs) multi-APKs. 
                The directories that are colored in blue—such as the drawable/, values/, 
                and lib/ directories—represent code and resources that Google Play uses to create configuration APKs for each module.
