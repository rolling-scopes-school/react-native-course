              For persisted user data, choose the right type of storage based on
              its sensitivity. As your app is used, you'll often find the need
              to save data on the device, whether to support your app being used
              offline, cut down on network requests or save your user's access
              token between sessions so they wouldn't have to re-authenticate
              each time they use the app.
              <br /><br />
              Persisted vs unpersisted — persisted data is written to the
              device's disk, which lets the data be read by your app across
              application launches without having to do another network request
              to fetch it or asking the user to re-enter it. But this also can
              make that data more vulnerable to being accessed by attackers.
              Unpersisted data is never written to disk—so there's no data to
              access!

              React Native does not come bundled with any way of storing
              sensitive data. However, there are pre-existing solutions for
              Android and iOS platforms.
              <br /><br />
              iOS - Keychain Services
              <br /><br />
              Keychain Services allows you to securely store small chunks of
              sensitive info for the user. This is an ideal place to store
              certificates, tokens, passwords, and any other sensitive
              information that doesn't belong in Async Storage.

              Shared Preferences is the Android equivalent for a persistent
              key-value data store. Data in Shared Preferences is not encrypted
              by default, but Encrypted Shared Preferences wraps the Shared
              Preferences class for Android, and automatically encrypts keys and

              The Android Keystore system lets you store cryptographic keys in a
              container to make it more difficult to extract from the device.

            <aside class="notes">
              Mobile apps have a unique vulnerability that is non-existent in
              the web: deep linking. Deep linking is a way of sending data
              directly to a native application from an outside source. A deep
              link looks like app:// where app is your app scheme and anything
              following the // could be used internally to handle the request.
              <br /><br />
              For example, if you were building an ecommerce app, you could use
              app://products/1 to deep link to your app and open the product
              detail page for a product with id 1. You can think of these kind
              of like URLs on the web, but with one crucial distinction:
              <br /><br />
              Deep links are not secure and you should never send any sensitive
              information in them.
              <br /><br />
              The reason deep links are not secure is because there is no
              centralized method of registering URL schemes. As an application
              developer, you can use almost any url scheme you choose by
              configuring it in Xcode for iOS or adding an intent on Android.
              <br /><br />
              There is nothing stopping a malicious application from hijacking
              your deep link by also registering to the same scheme and then
              obtaining access to the data your link contains. Sending something
              like app://products/1 is not harmful, but sending tokens is a
              security concern.
              <br /><br />
              When the operating system has two or more applications to choose
              from when opening a link, Android will show the user a
              Disambiguation dialog and ask them to choose which application to
              use to open the link. On iOS however, the operating system will
              make the choice for you, so the user will be blissfully unaware.
              Apple has made steps to address this issue in later iOS versions
              (iOS 11) where they instituted a first-come-first-served
              principle, although this vulnerability could still be exploited in
              different ways which you can read more about here. Using universal
              links will allow linking to content within your app securely in
              iOS.

              Using https endpoints could still leave your data vulnerable to
              interception. With https, the client will only trust the server if
              it can provide a valid certificate that is signed by a trusted
              Certificate Authority that is pre-installed on the client. An
              attacker could take advantage of this by installing a malicious
              root CA certificate to the user's device, so the client would
              trust all certificates that are signed by the attacker. Thus,
              relying on certificates alone could still leave you vulnerable to
              a man-in-the-middle attack.
              <br /><br />
              SSL pinning is a technique that can be used on the client side to
              avoid this attack. It works by embedding (or pinning) a list of
              trusted certificates to the client during development, so that
              only the requests signed with one of the trusted certificates will
              be accepted, and any self-signed certificates will not be.

            There is no bulletproof way to handle security, but with conscious
            effort and diligence, it is possible to significantly reduce the
            likelihood of a security breach in your application. Invest in
            security proportional to the sensitivity of the data stored in your
            application, the number of users, and the damage a hacker could do
            when gaining access to their account. And remember: it’s
            significantly harder to access information that was never requested
            in the first place.
