            On this slide you can see today’s agenda.
            <br /><br />
            We will start by talking about what animation is in general and how
            it can be done in React Native.
            <br /><br />
            Here we'll try animating with translation prop directly in JS thread
            and talk about why it is not a good idea. What React Native provides
            in terms of animation (Animated and LayoutAnimations APIs) and what
            are community provided solutions (Reanimated, Lottie, Rive to name a
            few)
            <br /><br />
            Next we'll dive into Animated API by checking code examples and
            discussing its limitations.
            <br /><br />
            LayoutAnimation is our next stop after which we'll take a closer
            look on Reanimated - the most popular and complex third-party
            solution for animation in React Native. What's the reasoning behind
            this library? What are the benefits over Animated and
            LayoutAnimation APIs? Of course there will be a coding section with
            hands on experience here.
            <br /><br />
            Last but not least, we'll try some other third party solutions for
            some really complex animations, like Lottie and more recent Rive
            libraries.
            <br /><br />
            At the end of all that, we'll have plenty time for QA and some
            conclusions. Buckle up and let's get started!

            In terms of mobile applications it is basically smoothly taking an
            object from one state to another. Animations allow you to convey
            physically believable motion in your interface. This way we can keep
            application users engaged and it can help to improve user experience
            on the whole.
